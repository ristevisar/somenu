# i3-cheat

`i3-cheat` is a simple program to display the current key bindings and key-binding modes for i3 (or sway). I created
this because sometimes I forget some of the keybindings I've set up for i3, but it is probably also useful if you are just starting to use
i3 and aren't used to the key bindings yet.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Gtk+ 3.0 or higher
- i3 or sway

## Installation

Just copy the i3-cheat to somewhere on your PATH
